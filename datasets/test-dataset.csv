I was greeted by an overwhelmingly welcoming and committed training environment. It's been fantastic getting to know the squad, who now feel like a family (mostly bonded through the shared pain of early morning swimming sessions). As captain, I have seen enormous improvements under my instruction in shooting and fencing and hope that we can build on that this coming year. My sights (shooting pun I know... sue me) are set on another team varsity victory; let's see if we can do what we do best and crush the dark blues! I look forward to welcoming the new freshers and sharing the best club with you all!	Rudi Bruijn-Yard	Men’s Captain	Anna Basford	Secretary	Laura Dearn	Armourer	CUMPC’s most senior current member, I’ve been with the club since 2017, when I started as a complete novice. Since then I have competed in 5 Varsity matches, been a part of 3 winning men’s teams, won both an individual BUCS gold in 2022 as well as the team gold in 2023, taken on multiple committee positions including President, Vice-President,and Treasurer, and coached swimming and shooting for the club over the years. With clinical rotations now taking up more of my time, I’ll be looking after the safety aspects of club life.

I am fortunate to be Old Blues President, which involves supporting the current CUMPC members and helping maintain the link with the alumni. The links between past and present CUMPC members are very strong, so much so we have run joint training camps abroad! We always look forward to meeting new CUMPC members throughout the year at various events, from the annual competition between current club and Old Blues, BUCS, Varsity and Annual dinner. Old Blues provide a lot of the volunteer support for these competitions and will be there cheering along from the sidelines!	I was involved in the club from 2015-2019 so know many of the recent Old Blues. I would love to hear from any alumni that wish to join our Old Blues mailing list to keep up to date with all the various events and news from the current club.”	FAQ	Most frequently asked questions and answers	How much does it cost?	We aim to keep our membership fee as affordable and accessible as possible, so we subsidise all training sessions! Subs per term are set at £70. This includes all training sessions and coaching!	Do I need to know how to ride?	No, many people learn to ride when they start while others only train for Tetrathlon (run, shoot, swim, fence).	Is there a varsity match?	Yes! Our annual Varsity match, held at Tonbridge School, is the main competition of the year and is consistently named by members as the highlight of their year.	I don't want to compete?	Then just train for fun!	Do I need my own kit?	No, the club provides most of it! You just need trainers and swimming kit.	Social Media	Interested in joining? Any questions? Feel free to reach out!

Paramhansa Yogananda	(5 Jan 1893–7 Mar 1952) was one of the first	Indian	teachers from the	Hindu	spiritual tradition to reside permanently in the West, and in particular, he was the first to teach yoga to	Americans	. He emphasized the universality of the great religions, and ceaselessly taught that all religions, especially Hinduism and Christianity, were essentially the same in their essence. The primary message of Yogananda was to practice the scientific technique of kriya yoga to be released from all human suffering.	He emigrated from India to the	United States	in 1920 and eventually founded the Self-Realization Fellowship there in	Los Angeles, California	. He published his own life story in a book called	Autobiography of a Yogi	, first published in 1946. In the book, Yogananda provided some details of his personal life, an introduction to yoga, meditation, and philosophy, and accounts of his world travels and encounters with a wide variety of saints and colorful personalities, including	Therese Neumann	,	Mohandas K. Gandhi	, Luther Burbank, and Jagadis C. Bose.	Paramhamsa, also spelled Paramahamsa, is a	Sanskrit	title used for	Hindu	spiritual teachers who have become enlightened. The title of Paramhansa originates from the legend of the swan. The swan (	hansa	) is said to have a mythical ability to sip only the milk from a water-and-milk mixture, separating out the more watery part. The spiritual master is likewise said to be able to live in a world like a supreme (	param	) swan, and only see the divine, instead of all the evil mixed in there too, which the worldly person sees.	Yogananda is considered by his followers and many religious scholars to be a modern avatar.	In 1946, Yogananda published his	Autobiography of a Yogi	. It has since been translated into 45 languages, and in 1999 was designated one of the ""100 Most Important Spiritual Books of the 20th Century"" by a panel of spiritual authors convened by Philip Zaleski and HarperCollins publishers.	Awake: The Life of Yogananda	is a 2014 documentary about Paramhansa Yogananda, in English with subtitles in seventeen languages. The documentary includes commentary by	George Harrison	and Ravi Shankar, among others.	[1]	[2]	Footnotes	Continued	...	Navigation menu	Search"

The examples are all implemented in JavaScript using the	Phaser	game framework, but the concepts and methods are general and can be adapted to any engine. Think of it as pseudocode. Each section contains several different examples that progress in sequence from a very basic implementation to a more advanced implementation. Every example is interactive and responds to keyboard or mouse input (or touch).	More...	My name is John. I've released a commercial 2D pixel art space game called	Gravity Ace	and I'd love for you to go check it out. I've wanted to make games since I was very young so I taught myself	how to do it	by participating in game jams. My goal in creating these examples was to provide a helpful resource for other game developers, particularly those who are just getting started, myself included.	Each example focuses on one concept and includes the source code for the implementation. They aren't meant to be extremely polished or to represent a complete game. They aren't highly optimized. They may not even be the best way to implement the mechanic being demonstrated! (They're certainly not the only way.) They are written for	clarity	so that it is easier to understand the underlying concepts and apply them to your own work in your own engine. I expect that some of these examples will evolve as I gain experience. But hopefully you'll find them useful and you can use them as a jumping off point for your own games.

Download	Buy now	Upgrade	The Kith and Kin series is the original Windows genealogy software, started in 1993 under Windows 3.1, and used by thousands of users in over 50 countries worldwide.	I absolutely LOVE your program!!!! I'd tried demos of several before finding and trying K&K and all the rest were very complicated and non-user friendly. K&K is so easy to learn and use.	Kith and Kin Pro is a genealogy software package for storing, querying and documenting family trees. It features a unique, easy to use graphical interface and powerful data management tools which makes it ideal for large or small trees.	Uniquely, the main screen displays the data as linked rectangles representing each family. Using the mouse, you can drag and position the family rectangles within the Tree Area to form any tree layout you desire. The family rectangles can be used for fast, direct access to data. You can zoom in and out of the tree to give you an overview of the entire tree layout.	Each family tree is stored in a relational database with a capacity of over 2,000 million records and you can have as many databases as you like. The software uses the powerful SQL (Structured Query Language) and other search tools to find data in the family tree. Results from searches can be used to form custom reports or exporting to other programs.	Navigating the tree on the screen is made easier by automatically highlighting related families. You can choose all families descended from a particular root family, all families containing ancestors of the root or just families which form a direct line between two families.	The families can be grouped into layers. By choosing to display only one layer at a time, it is possible to manage large trees which would otherwise be cluttered.	For the serious family historian, you can store information about the documentation you have used in your research. Recording source documents and repositories lets you go back to re-evaluate your findings at a later date.	I must admit to having looked at the competition recently but I've found nothing I like so much as KKPro with its intuitive interface and easy access to windows for recording sources.	You can also display a customizable timeline which displays a chronological list of events associated with selected families interspersed with notable events from history.	There are many different types of reports available, including drop-line charts and textual reports. All reports can also be exported to Adobe PDF files. The program has options enabling you to produce reports in any language.	Kith and Kin Pro exports Web pages, allowing you to easily publish your family tree on the Internet. The look and feel of the Web pages are fully customisable.	The software is GEDCOM V5.5 compatible so you can easily import data from other genealogy programs. Kith and Kin Pro also exports GEDCOM files.	Features	Download free trial	Download	What is shareware?	Try before you buy	A shareware program is an evaluation version of a program which you can try out to make sure that it meets your needs before buying it.	You can try out SpanSoft shareware programs free of charge for 30 days. After that, if you decide that you want to continue using the program, you must pay the appropriate registration fee. We will then email you a registration key which you use to turn the shareware version into a registered version, unlocking any additional features.	Registering the program brings various benefits including lifetime support and discounts on upgrades.	Details of the registration fees and how to order are in the program's help file or on this Web site.	You are free and encouraged to ""share"" the shareware versions with others."

He will be greatly missed by us all, please visit his tribute page to read more about the account of his illness to post your tribute and to see some of his happy memories...	Last Refuge Ltd. is a small Company dedicated to the support of endangered environments and species in our changing world, through films, images and research. We are also involved in aerial filming and photography. Over the past eight years, we have built a large archive of aerial photographs of Britain, and with our wing mount for Cessna aircraft, we facilitate remote sensing, infrared and mapping surveys internationally.	Last Refuge was established in 1992, while studying the plight of surviving wild Giant Pandas in the Qinling Mountains of Central China. Since that time, we have worked on projects in Ecuador, Venezuela, Guyana, Madagascar, Namibia, Tanzania, Mali, Morocco, Rwanda, Congo, Malaysia, Thailand, Europe, North America, and the United Kingdom.	2009 began with filming Dr George Schaller and mountain gorillas in Rwanda for	National Geographic	. Our new book	‘The Living Coast’	, an aerial journey around Britain’s coastline, had been published just before Christmas. It was our fourteenth aerial book since 2002. At home, work continued on building	wing mounts	for clients in Germany and Holland one to carry the	Red One	camera and the other a	FLIR	package for an energy conservation project. We carried out flight tests with a mount installed on a	Cessna 208B Caravan	and worked with EASA and FAA in order to expand our list of aircraft on our STC clearance. We are also working on new designs with varying degrees of stabilization, and with camera housings, for use in movie, stills and other aerial sensing applications. In May, we attended the wrap party and premiere of	Pixar Animation Studios	production	‘UP’	which we had been consulting on since 2006. For still photography, we finally took the plunge to digital, after using	Hasselblad	medium format film for 30 years, with a	Hasselblad	H3DII 50 megapixel system. We immediately used this on a trip to Venezuela, partly research, partly a recce for a new film project, together with a shoot for a travel company. Our stills archive continues to expand and our	Imacon	scanner has been working full time.

Additionally, Carla will be one of three judges for our Amateur Cook Off Competitions being held at 10 am and 2 pm on Saturday, September 7th.	About Carla…	Carla Hall first won over audiences when she competed on Bravo’s “Top Chef” and “Top Chef: All Stars” and shared her philosophy to always cook with love. She believes food connects us all, and she strives to communicate this through her work, her cooking, and in her daily interactions with others.	Carla spent 7 years co-hosting ABC’s Emmy award winning, popular lifestyle series “The Chew”, and is currently featured on the Food Network in shows such as “Thanksgiving, Holiday and Halloween Baking Championships” (judge), and “Worst Cooks in America”.	Her latest cookbook, Carla Hall’s Soul Food: Everyday and Celebration, was published in 2018, landing on annual “Best Cookbook” lists across the country and receiving an NAACP Image Awards nomination. In 2024, Carla is being honored by Les Dames d’Escoffier as Grande Dame, a lifetime achievement award and honorary title is given to members in recognition of extraordinary contributions within the fields of food, beverage and hospitality.	Hall published her debut picture book, Carla and the Christmas Cornbread, in November 2021, with Denene Millner Books, an imprint of Simon & Schuster Children’s Publishing. Illustrated by Cherise Harris, Carla and the Christmas Cornbread is a heartwarming tale loosely based on Hall’s childhood growing up in Nashville, TN, that celebrates family traditions, old and new, and also includes a child-friendly Christmas cornbread recipe perfect for the holidays.	She is active in many charitable endeavors and focuses her board member-level participation in organizations where she can make an impact advocating for children such as with 4H, Pajama Program, GenYouth, and Helen Keller International. In addition, Carla volunteers time to promote other non profit organizations such as: The James Beard Foundation, FEED America, Jacques Pepin Foundation, The Smithsonian Institutes and their membership of museums, and many others.

It was founded to provide degrees to members and clergy of the Church in recognition of the high degree of effort and intellectual rigor required to understand the finer points of doctrine of Apathetic Agnosticism. For further information on the Church of the Apathetic Agnostic and these degrees:	Recognizing that not everyone may wish to fully embrace Apathetic Agnosticism in order to obtain a free degree, the University will continue to offer until the end of 2018 a	Bachelor of Adequacy	degree for all of those who are prepared to certify that they are just about good enough. For details and the application form:	Please note	: The University has decided, that like Bitcoins, there should be a limit on the number of Bachelor of Adequacy degrees in circulation That limit was reached on 3 February, 2019. We regret degrees are no longer offered.	The International University of Nescience operates entirely online. There are no courses, no exams, no essays, and no thesis requirements. Degrees were granted based on each applicant’s personal assessment that his or her life experience qualified the applicant for the degree.*	Select the	Research	button for information on current research projects being undertaken by the University.	If you want to write to the University, please use the Contact Form on the	links	page.	* All Degrees are granted by the International University of Nescience, the educational arm of The Universal Church Triumphant of the Apathetic Agnostic. The University is a totally unaccredited institution, and advises applicants that its degrees may not receive the full recognition they deserve from third parties. The University stands behind its free emailed degrees with the claim that they are worth at least the paper they are printed on. The University wishes you good luck in using its free degrees on resumes and job applications. Do not expect the University to respond to requests for transcripts of marks from prospective employers.

This game was originally for the 82, 83, and 83+ series of calculators, as seen on	ticalc	. The port is an interesting technological feat, where an interpreter was written to handle system calls, keyboard, and controller input. The port also includes a new original soundtrack.	You can find the game on	itch.io	Discuss this article ( 5 )	Latest Members	Top Posters	DJ Omnimaga	55943 Posts	Deep Toaster	8217 Posts	Sorunome	7920 Posts	Eeems	6268 Posts	Munchor	6199 Posts	TIfanx1999	6173 Posts	Juju	5730 Posts	ztrumpet	5712 Posts	Builderboy	5673 Posts	Xeda112358	4704 Posts	Top Karma	DJ Omnimaga	Karma:	3154	Quigibo	Karma:	1075	thepenguin77	Karma:	823	Deep Toaster	Karma:	758	Xeda112358	Karma:	719	Runer112	Karma:	639	Builderboy	Karma:	613	squidgetx	Karma:	503	Juju	Karma:	500	leafy	Karma:	475"

The entire power circuitry of an amplifier can be seen as a community water system. The sun, driving the weather cycle, deposits water on the landscape, and it collects in a lake behind a dam. The community draws water as needed through pipes. In the winter, the rain collects in the…	More...

I collect sugar and sweetener packets - the packets which are served with coffee or tea in restaurants, coffee-houses etc. I would like to share this hobby and have contacts with many other collectors in a number of countries with whom I exchange sugar and sweetener packets, ideas, or just talk and be friends.	I invite first-time visitors to make the first stop at the Gallery. It is not too big at the moment, but I intend to enlarge it regularly. Unless otherwise noted, packets pictured in the Gallery are part of my collection.	EXCHANGING	There are two ways of packets exchange available:	The first one is based on offer/want lists. Please look at my OFFER/WANTED pages.	The second way functions without any lists. In this case I offer to exchange	empty packets only	(lots from 100 up to 200, each packet different) in return for the same number of packets. Please do not send tor	n	or otherwise damaged packets. To avoid damaging any packet I would suggest you use a fine blade to slit the packet along the edge to enable the sugar to be emptied.	Please sign my guestbook and let me know what you think of this site. Also feel free to contribute to this site with your own tips.
